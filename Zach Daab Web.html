        <h2>Junior Criminal Justice Major, Theatre Minor at Bob Jones Univerity</h2>
        
         <p>While many would see Criminal Justice and Theatre as an odd major and minor pairing, it has been very effective for me. At Bob Jones, we are encouraged to embrace what the arts have to offer, and I've taken that to heart. I have worked in Rodehaver Auditorium as Stage Crew and haved loved every second of it, rising to a Crew Chief postion in my Junior year.</p>
         <p>
            I love sports of all kinds,and am an avid Tampa Bay Rays, New England Patriots, and Florida Gators fan. I played baseball all through middle and highschool. I have manned every postion during a game and started at pitcher and firstbaseman many times. Some may be bored by it, but I love baseball.

            I'm also a fully certified geek, as signified by the Star Wars model collection residing on my desk. In addition to Star Wars, I love Marvel, DC, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem, Halo, and many, many more.
